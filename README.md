# Hype-3.0-Pro-Functions
This repository is dedicated to prebuilt functions that will work within Tumult Hype 3.0 and Hype 3.0 Professional.

Some things to remember about Hype Functions.

1. They work on the HTML5 DOM (Document Object Model)
2. Hype prefills some of the function scripting for you. for ease of explanation the scripts in this repository have the Hype prewritten    language in them.
However when copying or re-writing scripts for your Hype documents make sure that you only use the lines from **"function through the last }"**
